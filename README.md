𝟶𝟷 . 𝟷𝟻 . 𝟸𝟻　,,　I love Navia so much shes so pretty ‎ & ‎ i'm so in love with her (ToT) It's so strange because I often find myself more attracted to men ‎ & ‎ male aligned characters / people in general, but with Navia I am the same exact way. Everytime I see art of her I freak out in excitement because shes just so pretty ‎ & ‎ she makes me so so happy. I'd actually do anything for her, i'm so happy I have her in game, I don't know what I'd do without her CAUSE GIRL IS A POWERHOUSE! I adore her so very much, I even have a ring dedicated to her (we're literally married btw) I will never take it off ever. I am hoping to soon get a plushie of her or maybe just some sort of accessory related to her! I love my wife guys.

𝟶𝟽 . 𝟷𝟿 . 𝟸𝟺　,,　Me ‎ & ‎ my friend Suga were on Genshin when this Navia joined us ‎ & ‎ said they cheated on Suga with me. We ended up getting married in the Favonius Cathedral ‎ & ‎ they then proceeded to cheat on me with Suga ‎ & ‎ shot me with their umbrella gun, so I jumped off the Knights of Favonius tower (where the waypoint is) ‎ & ‎ we then came to a conclusion ‎ & ‎ became a polyamorus couple. After that we took a boat ride through Chenyu Vale ‎ & ‎ it was so beautiful.

𝟶𝟷 . 𝟸𝟿 . 𝟸𝟻　,,　I love Navia so much, she is so very dear to me. I love how passionate she is, her smile ‎ & ‎ the way she speaks so beautifly ‎ & ‎ gently, her style of fashion ‎ & ‎ self expression, the way she talks so sweetly about everyone, the way shes clumsy but in an elegant way, her bravery, her stubborness ‎ & ‎ persistence, her kind heart ‎ & ‎ way of helping ‎ & ‎ caring for others, I loved when she had made sure everyone was alright during the archon quest, it was so cute (ToT) Theres so many admirable things about her, augh she makes me so so happy I wanna kiss her so much!!!

𝟶𝟷 . 𝟹𝟶 . 𝟸𝟻　,,　I love the way you praise others! you’re so direct ‎ & ‎ clear, always speaking from your heart ‎ & ‎ truly meaning what you say. You're so sweet I wish I could be the same way, I really look up to you in that way. I can never get over how darling you are ♡ Your gentleness ‎ & ‎ sweetly spoken voice is just so adorable to me. I love how persistent you are, the way you never take no for an answer ‎ & ‎ always manage to set your priorities straight ‎ & ‎ make sure your opinions are heard no matter what the situation may be, is just so admirable. You're so pretty, your whole style matches so perfectly with your elegant ‎ & ‎ kind personality, I adore it so much ♡ You always know what to say, even when it may not be the right time to say it (ToT) You're just so perfect ‎ & ‎ I love you so much!
